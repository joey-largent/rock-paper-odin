Hello! This will be a test to practice making a rock-paper-scissors game with Javascript
It is an assignment in the odin project to practice and test JS

I want to make a note here that some of my choices may be inefficient, like adding html nodes almost entirely in javascript, and building CSS in html <styles>. However, this is to practice the techniques more than focusing on best practices for application load time.
